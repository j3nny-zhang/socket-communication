# UDP and TCP Socket Connection Project
This project demonstrates the creation of server and client applications that communicate using both UDP and TCP protocols. It includes examples of setting up sockets, sending and receiving messages, and handling basic error conditions.

## Features
**Client and Server:** Establishes a reliable, message-oriented communication channel (UDP). Once that is set up, a random port is set up on which lives a TCP connection-oriented communication channel.

## TO RUN SERVER:
./server.sh <req-code>

## TO RUN CLIENT:
./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <proto> <trace_to_send>
